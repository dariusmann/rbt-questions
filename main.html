                    <li><strong>A:</strong> This is the correct answer. Stimulus control transfer procedures involve teaching the learner to respond to new stimuli (unknown instructions) by initially discriminating them from known stimuli and gradually fading in the new stimuli while fading out the known stimuli.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>B:</strong> This is incorrect. Providing a reinforcer regardless of the client&#39;s response can reinforce both correct and incorrect responses and does not inherently lead to effective behavior change.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>C:</strong> This is incorrect. While verbal instruction can be beneficial, it alone does not constitute a stimulus control transfer procedure. Visual or physical guidance, along with reinforcement, are typically required to train new behaviors.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>D:</strong> This is incorrect. While negative reinforcement can play a role in behavior change, solely relying on it does not constitute a stimulus control transfer procedure.</li>

                    <li><strong>A:</strong> Access to tangible is incorrect because this function of behavior involves demonstrating a behavior to obtain a specific item or participate in an activity.

                    <li><strong>B:</strong> Escape/Avoidance is the correct answer. It is a common function of behavior where the child uses a certain behavior to escape from or avoid undertaking a particular task. In this case, the child screams to avoid doing chores.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>C:</strong> Attention seeking is incorrect because this function is related to behaviors that are meant to gain social attention or a reaction from others. In this instance, the child is not seeking attention but trying to escape a demand.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>D:</strong> Sensory stimulation is incorrect as it refers to a behavior that is internally pleasing and does not rely on external factors. Screaming to avoid chores fulfills an external function (escaping a chore), not an internal one.</li>

                    <li><strong>A:</strong> This option is incorrect because it limits the client&#39;s learned behavior to a specific environment (therapy room), contradicting the goal of generalization, which is to apply the learnt skill in various settings.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>B:</strong> Though varying the toys might help in stimulus generalization, it doesnât fully address the spatial aspect of generalization which promotes use of the skill in different environments.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>C:</strong> This is the correct answer. In order to promote generalization, an RBT should encourage the client to use the learnt skill of requesting a toy using a picture exchange in varied settings, not just the therapy room. This aids in promoting the transferability of the skill.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>D:</strong> This option is incorrect because having the client request a toy using a verbal phrase instead of a picture exchange is changing the way the skill was initially taught, which could lead to confusion rather than generalization.</li>

                    <li><strong>C:</strong> This response is correct because it&#39;s concrete, observable, and measurable. It includes both the behavior (&#39;hits his peers&#39;) and the frequency (3 times per hour). This is a good example of a measurable description.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>D:</strong> This option is not correct because &#39;seems sad&#39; is not a behavior that can be observed and measured, it requires interpretation of what being sad looks like.</li>

                    <li><strong>C:</strong> The correct first step is to identify and define the target behavior that will be reinforced in the presence of the specific stimulus.
